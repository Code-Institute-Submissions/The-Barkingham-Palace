# The Barkingham Palace

Welcome to The Barkingham Palace, a pet hotel focused on safety, luxury and creating lasting memories for all club members and their pups. We pride ourselves as being the only one of few with facilities that encompass everything from wedding events to pet surgery.

# UX

### OWNER USER STORIES

- As the owner of the pet hotel, I want to showcase my facilities so that guests can feel
at ease when leaving their pets with us.

- As the owner of the pet hotel, I want pet owners to join the royal club so that we could get recurring income and build a community.

- As the owner of the pet hotel, I want to showcase our commitment to safety so that we could gain the trust of the pet owners.

### DOG OWNER USER STORIES

- As the pet owner, I want to find a place to leave my pets at for a few days so that I can go on a holiday.

- As the pet owner, I want to let my dog socialise with other dogs in a safe environment so that my dog will not be so destructive at home.

- As the pet owner, I want to hang out with my friends and their pets so that we can have fun and create memories together.

- As the pet owner, I would like to know if the pet hotel is focused on safety so I can feel at ease.


As the pet owner, I would like to know the price of the pet hotel so I can see if it fits my budget.

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features Left to Implement

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
